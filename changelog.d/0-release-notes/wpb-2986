Added `shutdownGraceTime` as a config value for `background-worker`.

This field sets the grace period that `background-worker` has to finish processing current
messages before flushing and closing network connections. You will need to add this value to
your `background-worker` configuration, like this:

```
background-worker:
  config:
    shutdownGraceTime: 30
```
